Misquote - a Ruby on Rails Portfolio Project
==================

# Introduction
The intent of this project was to practice creating a Ruby on Rails app that uses a PostgreSQL DB and deploy it to Heroku.
It was created for the Mixed Messages problem promt on Codecademy. The scope of the prompt was only to generate random
messages in JavaScript, but it presented an opportunity to practice other skills I had been working on.
